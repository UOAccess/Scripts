Beginner Equipment Quest.
Created by Skarth.

This will give you VERY detailed step-by-step instructions for setting up this quest.  It should
   only take a few minutes if followed precisely.  (On all commands you "Type", hit "Enter" after
   typing them by the way, if you didn't already know.  Sorry for the extreme details)

Step 1 (Setting up Lothar)

	-Log on to your admin account and get somewhere in Trammel if not there already.

	-Type the following:  [go 3600 2576 20

	-Remember this spot where you are, move out of the way, and type:  [add Lothar

	-Target the spot you were just standing on (loc 3600 2576 20) and click it to add him.

Step 2 (Setting up Teleporter to Dungeon)

	-Type:  [go 3604 2570 20
	(this puts you in the room behind Lothar)

	-Remember this spot where you are, move out of the way, and type:  [add pentagramaddon

	-Target the spot you were just standing on (loc 3604 2570 20) and click it to add this.

	-Type:  [add teleporter

	-Click on the middle of the pentagram to add the teleporter.

	-Type:  [props

	-Target the teleporter and click. This will bring up options.

	-On the menu, to the right of "MapDest", click the arrow.

	-Click the arrow to the right of "Trammel".

	-Then on the menu, to the right of "PointDest", click the arrow.

	-At the bottom of this new menu, change the "X:0" to "X:6062", then change the "Y:0" to
		"Y:273", and finally the "Z:0" to "Z:-22", then click the arrow to right of them.

	-Remove the menu and step onto the teleporter (will put you at bottom of stairs)

Step 3 (Setting up Teleporter to Haven)

	-At the TOP of these stairs, set up 2 teleporters side by side using the [add teleporter
		commands like you did in Step 2.

	-Do [props on BOTH teleporters and change the "MapDest" to "Trammel", and change the
		"PointDest" to "X:3601", "Y:2570", "Z:20" (just like you did in Step 2). Make
		sure to do this for BOTH teleporters.

Step 4 (Setting up Brianna)

	-Type: [go 6048 362 44
	(this puts you near the end of the hall in this little dungeon)

	-Remember this spot where you are, move out of the way, and type:  [add Brianna

	-Target the spot you were just standing on (loc 6048 362 44) and click it to add her.

Step 6 (VERY RECOMMENDED)

	-I strongly recommend you add this to new characters upon character creation.  To do this
		open up your Scripts folder, then Misc folder, then CharacterCreation.cs.

	-You will see the following (or similar):

		PackItem( new RedBook( "a book", m.Name, 20, true ) );
		PackItem( new Gold( 1000 ) ); // Starting gold can be customized here
		PackItem( new Dagger() );
		PackItem( new Candle() );

	-Under your last option, type:  PackItem( new LetterofApprenticeship() );

	-It should now look like this:

		PackItem( new RedBook( "a book", m.Name, 20, true ) );
		PackItem( new Gold( 1000 ) ); // Starting gold can be customized here
		PackItem( new Dagger() );
		PackItem( new Candle() );
		PackItem( new LetterofApprenticeship() );

	-Of course, you may have added other things, but make sure the LetterofApprenticeship is
		in here.  One way or another, they HAVE to have this to begin the quest.  If you
		want this quest for characters that are already active on your shard, you need
		to give them a LetterofApprenticeship somehow.

	-You can type: "[add LetterofApprenticeship" and create it on the ground for them if you
		wish by the way.

Step 5 (Optional)

	-While you're down near Brianna, you may want to add some spawners with some easy mobs
		like Mongbats, Headless Ones, Horde Minions, etc.  But only if you wish.

	-I would recommend this, because Lothar's Gump when you hand him the first letter states
		that there will be "hordes of monsters" down there.  Either add them, or change
		his Gump.  (It's the LotharStartGump.cs if you wish to change what he says)

That's it!  Now the quest can be run as normal.
