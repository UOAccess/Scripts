Goblins! 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is my five Goblin scripts. They are as follows.
Goblin- Your basic goblin. Weaponless, with leather armor.
Goblin Raider- Just a common goblin with a Weapon.
Goblin Elite- An elite Goblin troop in Ringmail Armor.
Goblin Shamen- A robed goblin with a gnarled staff, uses spells.
Goblin Chieften- The leader of a group of Goblins, one of the strongest, in Platemail Armor, armed with a Halberd.

Also, I re-did the Oppositions Group, which can be found in Scripts\Engines\AI\Creatures. 
It must be replaced. 
The goblins themselves go in your Customs folder.
